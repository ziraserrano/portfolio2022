        <p>Ever since my first Nokia phone in 2000, and being able to play around with the styles on MySpace is when I truly began to fall in love with tech. I would always want (and try to get) the latest tech and be fascinated with how tech could change the lives of many in every aspect of life. However, since I was a little girl it was instilled in me to go to college and get a degree in a career that paid the big bucks. So through-out the years, I've searched for a career I could be passionate about which included Criminal Justice, Psychology and Nursing. From becoming a young mom at 18 years old, to now 29 with 4 kids, I have yet to finish my degree and feeling incomplete in those study fields was extremely stressful. My mindset began to shift and I decided I wouldn't do something for the money, rather I wanted to do something that made me happy. In the summer of 2022, while on the waiting list to get into Nursing school, I decided I would finally see what real programming was all about and teach myself some basics so I wouldn't have any regrets if I continued to pursue Nursing. I instantly fell in love with building websites and figuring out coding problems, and I immediately began to feel like THIS is the career path I was meant to pursue all these years. The instant gratification of solving challenges and building projects of my own and with others is what I've been searching for. I am excited to continue on this path of learning, and to officially break into tech and make this a lifelong career!</p>
