<!-- # Zira's Portfolio 2022
Welcome to my first portfolio that will showcase my work throughout my journey of learning how to code! I am super excited to finally have an easier way to show my work to future employers, as well as connect with others in tech and those just beginning their journey in learning how to code.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Sass

I used HTML5UP template to help create my portfolio! I changed some things around to match my vibe and added in some icons using *insert websites used here* and images using *insert websites used here*



<!-- ## Optimizations
*(optional)*

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews! -->

<!-- ## Lessons Learned:

<!-- No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *fuck yeah I did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing. -->
